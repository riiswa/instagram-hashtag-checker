# Instagram Hashtag Checker

Banned hashtags are hashtags that Instagram users have reported because the posts using them go against Instagramâ€™s guidelines. Using one of these can cause get your Instagram account shadowbanned (Google for more details). 

The Instagram Hashtag Checker tool aims to help you scan your account to detect bad hashtags in your posts.

I invite you to take a look at my [article](https://warisradji.com/2020/12/29/automatically-detect-banned-Instagram-hashtags/) to see how I found my solution.
